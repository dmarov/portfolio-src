        <p i18n="about education@@EDUCATION_ABOUT">
          Before beginning of my career as a software developer I've got solid
          math and computer science background in
          <b>NARFU "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science"</b>. At that time
          I participated in math and programming olympiads. As my base
          programming language I regarded <b>C++</b>
          but also I learned and worked with C, Java, Python, Assembly. I've
          graduated in 2017.

        <p i18n="career beginning commercial@@CAREER_BEGINNING_COMMERCIAL">
          I've started my career as a backend developer in 2017. It was my first
          experience of commercial software development and that's when I got
          acquainted with <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>. At the same time I took a
          grasp on frontend technologies such as <b>Gulp</b>, <b>Webpack</b>,
          <b>Sass</b>, <b>Babel</b>.
        </p>

        <p i18n="career frontend framework@@CARRIER_FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK">
          The time has come when native Javascript was not enough in order to
          keep implementing complex solutions in efficient way. That's when I
          made decision to learn <b>Vue</b> framework which payed out later.
        </p>

        <p i18n="career infrastructure@@CAREER_INFRASTRUCTURE">
          Path lead to resolve more complex problems related to outdated and
          unmaintainable infrastructure. Being experienced with <b>Node.js</b>
          In order to resolve some of existed problems I've implemented
          microservices. There are some of them:
        </p>

        <ul i18n="career micro services@@CAREER_MICRO_SERVICES">
          <li>
            <b>SMS sending gateway</b> - REST API to send SMS notifications
            using GSM gateway
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PDF generator</b> - REST API to convert HTML page to PDF (useful
            for printing invoices, and not just that)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>JWT token generator</b> - REST API to generate JWT token pairs
            (useful for authorization)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p i18n="career servies useful@@CAREER_SERVICES_USEFUL">
          These services were very useful for each new website.
        </p>

        <p i18n="career administering@@CAREER_ADMINISTERING">
          Since each service required separate environnment it required a lot of
          administering efforts, which I was also responsible for. I already had
          a lot knowledge about <b>FreeBSD</b> operating system, so it was time
          to apply this knowledge in practice.
        </p>

        <p i18n="career frontend@@CAREER_FRONTEND">
          Then I decided to specialize in frontend and move to bigger projects.
          That's when I've learned <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Angular</b>
          which became part of my main technology stack till current day. Such
          aspects as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), implementing end-to-end
          tests, pixel perfect markup, cross browser development, accessibility
          - this is what I'm most focused on at work.

          At present I realize that I've experienced a lot and can formulate
          what kind of developer I am:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <!--
            SOLID
            BDD
            Refactoring
            Code integration`
            Asking questions
            Argumentation
            Bug priority
            Code formatting
            Naming
          -->
          <li i18n="code formatting principle@@PRINCIPLE_CODE_REFACTORING">
            I am huge advocate for code quality in long term products, because
            it allows to reduce future work as well for other developers and
            reduces amount of potential bugs
          </li>
          <li i18n="code formatting principle@@PRINCIPLE_CODE_FORMATTING">
            I am huge advocate for uniform code formatting, because it reduces
            distractions and helps to focus on application architecture
          </li>
          <li i18n="asking questions principle@@PRINCIPLE_ASKING_QUESTIONS">
            I consider that ability to ask correct questions is the most
            valuable skill a developer can have
          </li>
          <li i18n="argumentation principle@@PRINCIPLE_ARGUMENTATION">
            I consider that every significant consideration should have valid
            argumentation in order to be legit
          </li>
          <li i18n="actions base principle@@PRINCIPLE_ACTIONS_BASE">
            I consider that actions of software developer should be based on
            principles
          </li>
          <li i18n="refactoring principle@@PRINCIPLE_REFACTORING">
            I consider that refactoring should be regarded as a part of a task
            rather than a a separate process
          </li>
          <li i18n="specialization principle@@PRINCIPLE_SPECIALIZATION">
            I consider that developer should not be locked into narrow
            specialization, but have opportunities to learn adjacent domains
            from colleagues
          </li>
          <li i18n="code integration principle@@PRINCIPLE_CODE_INTEGRATION">
            I am huge advocate for fast code integration such as "trunk based
            flow", because it reduces bugs due to complicated conflicts for a
            coast of releasing incomplete features
          </li>
          <li i18n="bugs priority principle@@PRINCIPLE_BUGS_PRIORITY">
            I consider that fixing bugs should be topmost priority, because
            released feature is done when it's working, and it's working when it
            has no bugs
          </li>
          <li i18n="agile principle@@PRINCIPLE_AGILE">
            I consider that Agile principles for software development are worth
            following, mainly because it allows to provide fast feedback. Agile
            is not a solution for every problem and has disadvantages, but I
            think that advantages outweight disadvantages considerably
          </li>
          <li i18n="BDD principle@@PRINCIPLE_BDD">
            I consider that long term product should be developed using
            <b>BDD</b> (Behavior Driven Development) process. Writing test after
            the fact results in poor test quality and poor code design.
            <b>TDD</b>
            (Test Driven Development) is a good approach as well but it has gone
            completely wrong in a sense of what for developer should write a
            test. BDD is the best approach I've experienced so far. I don't
            think it is necessary to follow BDD principles in order to get good
            software design, but it's very handy to have extra verification for
            correctness of behavior
          </li>
          <li i18n="naming principle@@PRINCIPLE_NAMING">
            I think that naming is the hardest part of development process, as
            once was said
            <i>
              "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache
              invalidation and naming things."
            </i>
