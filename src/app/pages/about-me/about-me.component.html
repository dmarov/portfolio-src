          In order to start my career as a software developer I've got solid
          math and computer science background in
          <b>NARFU "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science"</b>. At that time
          I participated in math and programming olympiads. As my base
          programming language I regarded <b>C++</b>
          but also I learned and worked with C, Java, Python, Assembly. I've
          graduated in 2017.

          Short after that I've started my career as backend developer. It was
          my first experience of commercial software development and that's when
          I got acquainted with <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>, as well as frontend
          technologies such as <b>Gulp</b>, <b>Webpack</b>, <b>Sass</b>,
          <b>Babel</b>.

          The time has come when native Javascript was not enough in order to
          keep implementing complex solutions in efficient way. That's when I
          made decision to learn <b>Vue</b> framework which payed out later.

          Path lead to resolve more complex problems related to outdated and
          unmaintainable infrastructure. Being experienced with <b>Node.js</b>
          In order to resolve some of existed problems I've implemented
          microservices. There are some of them:
        </p>

        <ul i18n="career micro services@@CAREER_MICRO_SERVICES">
          <li>
            <b>SMS sending gateway</b> - REST API to send SMS notifications
            using GSM gateway
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PDF generator</b> - REST API to convert HTML page to PDF (useful
            for printing invoices, and not just that)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>JWT token generator</b> - REST API to generate JWT token pairs
            (useful for authorization)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p
          i18n="career servies useful@@CAREER_SERVICES_USEFUL"
          class="text-page__p"
        >
          These services was very useful for each new website.
        </p>

        <p
          i18n="career administering@@CAREER_ADMINISTERING"
          class="text-page__p"
        >
          Since each service required separate environnment it required a lot of
          administering efforts, which I was also responsible for. I already had
          a lot knowledge about <b>FreeBSD</b> operating system, so it was time
          to apply this knowledge in practice.
        </p>

        <p i18n="career frontend@@CAREER_FRONTEND" class="text-page__p">
          Then I decided to specialize in front-end and move to big projects.
          That's when I've learned <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Angular</b>
          which became part of my main technology stack till current day. Such
          aspects as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), implementing UI test,
          pixel perfect markup, cross browser development, accessibility - this
          is what I'm most focused on at work.
