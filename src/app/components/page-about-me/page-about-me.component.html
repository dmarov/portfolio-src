                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated <b>NARFU "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science"</b> in 2017.
                    This is when I started my career as backend <b>PHP developer</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never lost opportunity to learn new technology, and this how I also moved into frontend.
                    That's when I was required to learn how to use <b>Vue/webpack</b> to resolve existed engineering problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time I developed microservices using <b>Node.js</b> to resolve existed infrastructural problems.
                    Such services as <b>SMS sending gateway</b>, <b>PDF generator</b> and <b>JWT token generator</b>
                    was implemented by me and used later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I was responsible for administering servers, which had FreeBSD as an oparating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that I decided to become frontend developer on the whole new level.
                    That's when I've learned <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Angular</b> which became part of my main technology stack till current day.
