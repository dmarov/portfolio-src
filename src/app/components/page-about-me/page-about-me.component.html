      <h1 i18n="career" class="text-page__title">Career</h1>
      <p i18n="career start" class="text-page__p">
        In order to start my career as a software developer I've got solid math
        and computer science background in
        <b>NARFU "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science"</b>. At that time I
        participated in math and programming olympiads. As my base programming
        language I regarded <b>C++</b>
        but also I learned and worked with C, Java, Python, Assembly. I've
        graduated in 2017.
      </p>

      <p i18n="career start commercial" class="text-page__p">
        Short after that I've started my career as backend developer. It was my
        first experience of commercial software development and that's when I
        got acquainted with <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>, as well as frontend
        technologies such as <b>Gulp</b>, <b>Webpack</b>, <b>Sass</b>,
        <b>Babel</b>.
      </p>

      <p i18n="career frontend framework" class="text-page__p">
        The time has come when native Javascript was not enough in order to keep
        implementing complex solutions in efficient way. That's when I made
        decision to learn <b>Vue</b> framework which payed out later.
      </p>

      <p i18n="career infrastructure" class="text-page__p">
        Path lead to resolve more complex problems related to outdated and
        unmaintainable infrastructure. Being experienced with <b>Node.js</b>
        In order to resolve some of existed problems I've implemented
        microservices. There are some of them:
      </p>

      <ul i18n="career micro services">
        <li>
          <b>SMS sending gateway</b> - REST API to send SMS notifications using
          GSM gateway
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PDF generator</b> - REST API to convert HTML page to PDF (useful
          for printing invoices, and not just that)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>JWT token generator</b> - REST API to generate JWT token pairs
          (useful for authorization)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p i18n="career servies useful" class="text-page__p">
        These services was very useful for each new website.
      </p>

      <p i18n="career administering" class="text-page__p">
        Since each service required separate environnment it required a lot of
        administering efforts, which I was also responsible for. I already had a
        lot knowledge about <b>FreeBSD</b> operating system, so it was time to
        apply this knowledge in practice.
      </p>

      <p i18n="career frontend" class="text-page__p">
        Then I decided to specialize in front-end and move to big projects.
        That's when I've learned <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Angular</b>
        which became part of my main technology stack till current day. Such
        aspects as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), implementing UI test, pixel
        perfect markup, cross browser development, accessibility - this is what
        I'm most focused on at work.
